# Git-p4 plugin for Magit #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lexa/magit-p4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lexa/magit-p4)

Attention! This is in development. Some of the info below is nothing but a plain lie!

## Requirements ##

Emacs 24.x with `magit-2.1` or newer and `p4` packages installed. You do not have to install these packages if you use Melpa service - all required dependencies will be downloaded altogether with `magit-p4`.
`git-p4` add-on is obviously required.

## Installation ##

The package should be available via Melpa service using elpa packages mechanism.
If you plan to enable the package manually be sure to have `magit` and `p4` installed already
and add the downloaded package directory to Emacs `load-path`:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-magit-p4-directory")

and then you should call:

    (require 'magit-p4)

Evalutation of the package code is sufficient to plug into `magit` menu some helpful key bindings.

## Usage ##

Being inside Magit status buffer one should press `?` key to reveal magit menu. The menu should be equipped with <kbd>4</kbd> key binded to `magit-p4` submenu, all right. The submenu has four items which represent four activities implemented by `git-p4` add-on:

* Cloning - bound to key <kbd>`c`</kbd> and `magit-p4-clone` function;
* Syncing - bound to key <kbd>`s`</kbd> and `magit-p4-sync` function;
* Rebasing - bound to key <kbd>`r`</kbd> and `magit-p4-rebase` function;
* Submitting - bound to key <kbd>`S`</kbd> (capital "s") and `magit-p4-submit` function.

After one of the activities is chosen another menu appears where one may specify additional options and arguments - like `magit` does.

One may use `magit-p4` function outside `magit` buffer but be sure to do it while the active buffer reflects a directory _inside_ Git repository. Some of these four functions make use of command prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>).

### Cloning ###

Press <kbd>4</kbd> key in `magit` main menu and then <kbd>`c`</kbd> key. The submenu presents some additional switches and arguments. The most important argument is `=d` (destination directory). Without specifying this argument the default directory will be used for cloning which may not be appropriate. Then one must press <kbd>`c`</kbd> key once more. The minibuffer will ask for P4 depot to clone. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> key invokes completion (here `p4` package comes with help). Unfortunately, the completion might be longsome due to network communication. The cloning process is launched asynchronously so one must visit *magit process* buffer from time to time to know cloning current status.

You may use directly `magit-p4-clone` command prepending with <kbd>C-u</kbd> - the command will ask you for target directory after you choose P4 depot to clone.

### Syncing ###

Press <kbd>4</kbd> key in `magit` buffer followed with <kbd>`s`</kbd> key. The submenu presents some additional switches and arguments for `git-p4 sync` command. Press <kbd>`s`</kbd> once again and the synchronization starts. If command prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>) has been pressed before the final <kbd>`s`</kbd> you will be presented with minibuffer asking for P4 depot path to sync with (of course the completion will work thanks to `p4` package).

### Rebasing ###

While visiting *magit status* buffer press <kbd>4</kbd> and <kbd>`r`</kbd> key. Additional switches are provided in rebase submenu. Finally press <kbd>`r`</kbd> key.

### Submitting ###

While visiting *magit status* buffer press <kbd>4</kbd> and <kbd>`S`</kbd> key. Additional switches are provided in submit submenu. Press <kbd>`s`</kbd> key to submit. A buffer will appear where you may add some more info
to submitted change-set log. Press <kbd>C-x</kbd><kbd>#</kbd> to confirm (`emacsclient` is used).
